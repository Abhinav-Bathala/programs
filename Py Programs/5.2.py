#Chapter 5, Challenge 2
'''
Write a Character Creator program for a role-playing game. The
player should be given a pool of 30 points to spend on four
attributes: Strength, Health, Wisdom, and Dexterity. The
player should be able to spend points from the pool on any
attribute and should also be able to take points from an
attribute and put them back into the pool.
